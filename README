This is a video game engine Priten Vora, Jon Pichetti, and I developed
in an approximately 12 hour period for a programming competition at the
University of Illinois in Champaign. For the amount of time invested, I
am pretty proud of our accomplishment.

Work Distribution:
Jon Pichetti - Worked on sound engine, loading screen, and full screen mode
