This is a video game engine Priten Vora, Jon Pichetti, and I developed
in an approximately 12 hour period for a programming competition at the
University of Illinois in Champaign. For the amount of time invested, I
am pretty proud of our accomplishment.

It runs entirely in the web browser using HTML5's canvas element and
javascript. Best viewed with Google Chrome, but we tried to be as
browser independent as possible.

Work Distribution:
Jon Pichetti - Worked on sound engine, loading screen, and full screen mode
Priten Vora - Artwork
William Blankenship - Anything not covered by the other two.
